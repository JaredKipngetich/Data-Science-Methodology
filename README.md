# Data-Science-Methodology
This is how I would approach a Data science Methodology Problem 

1.Analytic Approach
Here i would adopt a descriptive approach, this will be helpful in establishing the similarities and the relationships between the complaints of the different clients. Descriptive approach is ideal in this scenario since we are dealing with set of similar complaints.

2.Data Requirements.
First we need to identify the kind of data required for this task, we require complaints from the users of the credit cards and the financial data from the users of the credit cards. Here we shall ask the users of these credit cards to furnish us with their credit card statements and their complaints. The next step is identifying the source of the data, in this case we shall source data from the users of the credit cards and the bank. The next step would be classifying the users according to the complaints they made.

3. Data Collection
Complaints shall be recorded from the users alongside their respective credit card statements, the data will be in a structured form. Here we shall determine if the data collected initially has what it is needed to solve the problem at hand or whether we require more data, we shall also use visualization tools to asses the content.

4. Data understanding and preparation.
In the case of incomplete data, here shall determine if they will be skipped, we shall also check for incomplete and misleading data, for data which is closely related, we shall use technics which check for correlation. We shall apply the use of tools of statistics such as the histogram to show the frequency of occurrence of certain events such as failure of credit cards at point of sale terminals.

5.Modeling and Evaluation
we had earlier on settled on descriptive model, this therefore means that we shall prepare a training set that we will use to fine tune the model in order to make it better, we shall use a data set with a known outcome on this stage, we will be looking at making the model identify which stores appeared in majority of the complains and what was unique about the store, this is not only limited to the store but to all the outlets mentioned by the users of the credit card. Parameter tuning is the preferred tool here. In the evaluation part, we shall use the two stages, the diagnostic part to ensure that the model is working as intended and the statistical significance will be used to give us the assurance that the answer will be true.
